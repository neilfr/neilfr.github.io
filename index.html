                            Well… it only took 27 years, but I’m finally back… and writing code again!  Feels great – like the shackles have finally been removed! 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1987, for my first co-op employer, I designed and wrote my first commercial application using Microsoft Pascal – yes, believe it or not, they had a Pascal compiler for a time.  My application sold enough copies that my employer made a decent profit after paying my wage for 3 work terms.  A few more work terms doing Fortran and Cobol for a large utilities company, and I graduated into full-time work.
                        </p>
                       
                        <p>
                            Then, I followed the opportunities and the money that came my way - and it took me into technical sales… then technical marketing… then marketing… and managing an IT team.  Somehow that kid that loved to pound out code for kicks on a Commodore VIC-20 after school got lost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally getting back to what I love!  One assignment down and I can’t wait for the next one!  
                        </p>
